## Definition

According to the site MDN WEB DOCS, "Object-oriented programming is about modeling a system as a collection of objects, where each object represents some particular aspect of the system. Objects contain both functions (or methods) and data. An object provides a public interface to other code that wants to use it but maintains its own private, internal state; other parts of the system don't have to care about what is going on inside the object."

## Key Concepts of OOP:

**Classes and Objects:** A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. Objects are instances of classes and represent real-world entities with properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods).

**Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is the wrapping of data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) into the class, so only the class will have access to the attributes or methods. It's very important to protect data.

**Inheritance:** Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass).

**Polymorphism:** Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables methods to behave differently based on the object that calls them.

**Abstraction:** Abstraction involves simplifying systems by dividing classes into small ones, based on their essential characteristics while hiding irrelevant details.
